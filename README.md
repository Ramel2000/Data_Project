My Personal Data Science Projects : 
1. Heart Disease Project
The Heart Disease Project aims to determine whether a patient has heart disease based on their characteristics. By analyzing various patient data, the project employs predictive modeling techniques to classify patients and assess their risk factors for heart disease. The evaluation metric used to measure the model's performance is accuracy, which indicates the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.

2. Bulldozer Regression Project
The Bulldozer Regression Project is a time series analysis project that aims to predict the prices of bulldozers that will be sold during the year 2012. This prediction is based on the characteristics of bulldozers sold in previous years. The project utilizes historical sales data and employs regression techniques to forecast future pricing trends. The evaluation metric for this project is the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMLSE), which measures the accuracy of the predictions by comparing the logarithm of the predicted and actual prices.
